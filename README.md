# Geeks for Geeks 160 Days Challenge - Java Solutions

Welcome to the **Geeks for Geeks 160 Days Challenge** repository! This repository contains my Java-based solutions to the problems tackled during the challenge. 
It is aimed at improving problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and Java programming expertise.

## 📋 Challenge Overview
The 160 Days Challenge is designed to solve a variety of coding problems daily, focusing on algorithms, data structures, and other computer science concepts.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Any preferred Java IDE
## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
